I am currently persuing my third year under-graduate studies in B-tech CSE. I am very much passionate about cyber security and especially focus in the field of cryptogrpahy and Reverse engineering. I actively try to improve my skills in security by playing and learning from CTF's as a part of Team bi0s [ ***academic ethical hacking team of Amrita University*** ].

# Interests

<br/>

I am familiar with the concepts and attacks related to various cryptographic systems as RSA, Block Ciphers, DLP, Elgamel, ECC, PRNGS's etc. I have lots more to cover in terms of knowledge in this field and constantly learn practice and implement new concepts. 

<br />

I have attempted the Metassano challenges as way to increase my understanding on crypto related attacks and concepts.I have completed university courses in Linear algebra and Discrete Mathematics especially on number theory. I am familiar with C, C++, Java, Javascript and python and also have experience with X-86 assembly language and MIPS architecture.

<br />

Some of the code that I have written to solve CTF challenges and implementations of various cryptosystems and their related attacks along with my solutions to cryptopals problems can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Vishvesh-rao) page. I also constantly keep solving challenges from [CRYPTOHACK](https://cryptohack.org/) [ ***a platform for learning crypto related concepts*** ] and am currently listed in the [top 20]( https://cryptohack.org/user/CRYPT1K/)  in India on the scoreboard.
